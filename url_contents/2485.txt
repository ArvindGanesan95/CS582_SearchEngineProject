The instructor must submit an Incomplete Grade Assignment report when entering final grades for the I to be recorded. This report is a contract for the student to complete the course work with that instructor or one designated by the department executive officer in the way described and by a time indicated on the report. In resolving the I, the student may not register for the course a second time, but must follow the procedures detailed on the report.  An I must be removed within one calendar year subsequent to the incurrence of the I. When the student submits the course work, the instructor will grade it and change the I to the appropriate grade.  If an undergraduate student fails to meet the stated conditions, an F will be assigned for the final grade. </td>

<h4>Credit/No Credit Option</h4>
<p>Students may elect to take a course under the credit/no credit option according to the following provisions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The student must be in good standing as defined by the chosen college.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 21 semester hours of credit may be earned at UIC under the credit/no credit option. If a student withdraws from a credit/no credit course before the end of the last day of instruction in the tenth week of the term, the semester hours the course carries will not count toward the total of 21 authorized.</li>
	<li>No more than one course per term may be taken under this option.</li>
	<li>This option may not be used in any course required for the major, including prerequisite and collateral courses.<sup>a</sup></li>
	<li>The option may not be used for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGL%20160" title="ENGL 160" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGL 160');">ENGL 160</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGL%20161" title="ENGL 161" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGL 161');">ENGL 161</a></span>.</li>

	<li>The credit/no credit option in a course must be elected by the end of the tenth day of instruction of the term.</li>
	<li>The credit/no credit option in a course cannot be revoked after the close of the tenth day of instruction in the term.</li>
	<li>A college or school may by action of its faculty institute a more restrictive policy for any or all of the above provisions.</li>
	<li>Instructors are not informed that the option has been elected but assign a letter grade in the usual manner. The Office of the Registrar retains a record of that letter grade in the student records system, but it is not entered on the student transcript, except as hereafter provided.</li>
	<li>For courses taken under the credit/no credit option, a grade of CR is recorded on the transcript if a letter grade of A, B, C, or D is earned. If the letter grade F is assigned, an NC is entered on the transcript. Grades of I and DFR are replaced by CR or NC upon completion of the courses or converted to NC if the course completion deadline for an I is not met.</li>
	<li>The grades of CR and NC are not used in the computation of the GPA.</li>
	<li>Grades of CR and NC are final and cannot be reconverted to letter grades, except under the following circumstances. If, during the student’s final term prior to graduation, it is found that one or more of the courses needed to satisfy major field requirements were completed under the credit/no credit option at UIC (prior to the declaration of the major or prior to intercollegiate or intercurricular transfer), the student may elect that a sufficient number of CR grades be replaced by the originally assigned letter grades to meet major requirements. Only the minimum number of reconversions will be made. If such a minimum can be met by more than one selection of reconversions, the student may indicate a preference. This same policy applies in the case of any additional restrictions instituted by a college or school under Provision 8.</li>
	<li>Students must apply at their college office no later than the tenth day of the term (first Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or first Friday of Summer Session 2) to have a course designated for credit/no credit grading option.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Calculating the Grade Point Average (GPA)</h4>
<p>Take the grades for each course taken and determine the grade points per hour: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Multiply the grade points per hour for each course by the number of semester hours for the course to get the grade points for each course.</li>
	<li>Add the grade points for each course to get the total number of grade points for the semester.</li>
	<li>Add the semester hours taken for each course to get the total number of semester hours.</li>
	<li>Divide total number of grade points for the semester by the total number of semester hours taken.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following example illustrates how to calculate the GPA.</p>

<p>The GPA for the example above is 38 divided by 17 or 2.23 on a 4.00 scale (2.23/4.00).</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Courses numbered 001–099 do not carry credit toward graduation. Grades for these courses are not calculated in the GPA.</p>
<h3>Time Limit on Grade Changes</h3>
<p>Changes/corrections to final grades are permitted up to two years after recording the final grade in a student’s academic record so long as the course instructor, department chair/head, and college office approve of the change/correction. No grade changes/corrections are allowed after the two-year time limitation. Colleges are permitted, however, to adopt a more restrictive time limit policy. Students should check with their colleges concerning the time limit policy.</p>
<h2><span>Academic Policy Modifications due to COVID-19</span></h2>
<h3><span>Spring 2020</span></h3>
<p><span>Due to the unprecedented nature that the COVID-19 pandemic and the university, city, state, and federal mandates associated with it are having on the student body at UIC, and with the consent of the UIC Senate Executive Committee and the college deans, the Office of the Provost is enacting the following modifications to the grading policy for undergraduate students at UIC for the Spring 2020 semester:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Grading Modifications for Undergraduate students for Spring 2020 </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Instructors will report a letter grade for every student in the course as usual.</li>
		<li><u>Students may elect whether they want to take any course in which they are currently enrolled as Credit/No Credit (CR/NC)</u>.
		<ul>
			<li>Once the election is made, it cannot be reversed.</li>
			<li>The student will not receive a grade for any course taken as CR/NC.</li>
			<li>A course taken as CR/NC will not be calculated into the student’s GPA.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>For every course, and regardless of whether a student elects to take the course as Credit/No Credit, a grade of D will automatically be recorded on the student’s transcript as Credit (CR), and a grade of F will be recorded as No Credit (NC). No student will receive a D or F on their transcript for any Spring 2020 course.</li>
		<li>The deadline for students to elect to take any course under the CR/NC option is <u>Wednesday, April 29, 2020</u>. This selection does not require instructor, departmental, or college approval.
		<ul>
			<li>Students will receive instructions in early April about how to make this election.</li>
			<li>Students are strongly encouraged to consult their academic advisor in their college before making this election.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Students who do not affirmatively elect to take a course CR/NC will be graded in the usual way, except that a D will appear on their transcript as CR, and an F will appear as NC, as stated above.</li>
		<li>Instructors will not be informed that the CR/NC option has been elected and will assign a letter grade in the usual manner, as required by the CR/NC Credit Option <a href="https://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/degree-programs/academic-standing/#gradinggradepointsys">policy</a>.</li>
		<li>For Spring 2020 only, courses graded as CR/NC can be used to satisfy major, minor, General Education, foreign language, and Quantitative Reasoning requirements. Exclusions may apply to programs with licensing agency and/or accreditation board requirements and students in such programs should consult with their academic advisors.</li>
		<li>A student may elect to take as many courses as they wish for CR/NC grading and these courses will not count toward the number of courses or semester hours students can earn under the CR/NC option in one term or in total.</li>
		<li><u>Any change in grading policies for graduate and professional students are NOT covered in this</u><u> policy</u> and will be treated by a separate policy.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Courses with Prerequisites</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Courses that require a minimum grade in a previous course in order for that previous course to serve as a prerequisite will allow the CR grade as fulfilling that requirement if that previous course was taken during the Spring 2020 semester.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Course Withdrawals/Undergraduate Late-Drop Course Policy Modification</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Courses dropped late (i.e., after the add/drop period) resulting in a ‘W” notation on the student’s transcript in Spring 2020, Summer 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021 semesters will <u>not</u> be counted toward the maximum of four late-drop courses over the duration of an undergraduate degree program. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Incomplete Grades and Academic Probation ***should this section be added to Fall 2020/Spring 2021 - it was not included in the press release***</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Students who received an Incomplete grade for courses taken prior to Spring 2020 will be given an additional semester to fulfill the requirements of their Incomplete grade.</li>
		<li>Students on probation who do not get off probation based on their college requirements in Spring 2020 will have an additional semester to fulfill their probation requirements and will not be penalized for taking courses CR/NC.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Financial Aid Implications</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) will still be assessed at the end of the spring semester for all enrolled students.</li>
		<li>CR/NC courses will not count in the students cumulative GPA for SAP purpose.
		<ul>
			<li>Students must still maintain a 2.00 cumulative GPA after 60 attempted hours.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Courses recorded as NC will count as an attempted/not completed course in a student’s overall completion rate and maximum time frame calculation.
		<ul>
			<li>Students must maintain an overall completion rate of 67% to remain eligible for financial aid.</li>
			<li>Students must not have exceeded 180 attempted credits to remain eligible for financial aid.</li>
			<li>Students failing SAP at the end of this spring semester can still appeal the decision after cancellation occurs.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 </h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Grading Modifications for Undergraduate students for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Instructors will report a letter grade for every student in their courses as usual.</li>
		<li>All grades of A, B, and C will be recorded on transcripts as usual.</li>
		<li>All grades of D will automatically be recorded on the student’s transcript as Credit (CR), and all grades of F will be recorded as No Credit (NC).  No student will receive a D or F on their transcript for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021.</li>
		<li>Under this policy, a grade of CR can be used to satisfy General Education requirements.</li>
		<li>Grades of CR and NC are not included in the student’s GPA calculation.</li>
		<li>CR/NC grades under this policy will not count toward the number of courses or credit hours students can elect to take CR/NC in one term or during their undergraduate program.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Courses with Prerequisites</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Courses with a grade of CR completed during the Fall 2020 or Spring 2021 semester will <u>not</u> fulfill prerequisite requirement if the prerequisite necessitates a grade of C or better.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Course Withdrawals/Undergraduate Late-Drop Course Policy Modification</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Courses dropped late (i.e., after the add/drop period) resulting in a ‘W” notation on the student’s transcript in Spring 2020, Summer 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021 semesters will <u>not</u> be counted toward the maximum of four late-drop courses over the duration of an undergraduate degree program. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Financial Aid Implications</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) will still be assessed at the end of Spring 2021 semester for all enrolled students.
		<ul>
			<li>W and CR/NC courses will not count in the student’s cumulative GPA for SAP purpose.
			<ul>
				<li>Students must still maintain a 2.00 cumulative GPA after 60 attempted hours.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Courses recorded as W and NC will count as an attempted/not completed course in a student’s overall completion rate and maximum time frame calculation.
		<ul>
			<li>Students must maintain an overall completion rate of 67% to remain eligible for financial aid.</li>
			<li>Students must not exceed 180 attempted credits to remain eligible for financial aid.</li>
			<li>Students failing SAP at the end of Spring 2021 semester can appeal the decision after cancellation occurs.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Further details about the effect of these policies on specific issues, such as the effect of a grade of CR on issues of progression in foreign languages and quantitative reasoning, as well as licensure requirements for some degree programs, will be provided by individual colleges and programs as necessary. </p></div><!--end #textcontainer -->
