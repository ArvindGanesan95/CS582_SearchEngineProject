Course work is incomplete when a student fails to submit all required assignments or is absent from the final examination. Incomplete course work will normally result in a failing grade if it is not completed within the designated time limit. The I may be assigned in lieu of a grade only when all of the following conditions are met: (a) the student has been making satisfactory progress in the course; (b) the student is unable to complete all course work due to unusual circumstances that are beyond personal control and are acceptable to the instructor; and (c) the student presents these reasons prior to the time the final grade roster is due.  The instructor must submit an Incomplete Grade Assignment report when entering final grades for the I to be recorded. This report is a contract for the student to complete the course work with that instructor or one designated by the department executive officer in the way described and by a time indicated on the report. In resolving the I, the student may not register for the course a second time, but must follow the procedures detailed on the report.  An I must be removed within one calendar year subsequent to the incurrence of the I. When the student submits the course work, the instructor will grade it and change the I to the appropriate grade.  If an undergraduate student fails to meet the stated conditions, an F will be assigned for the final grade. </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"column0\">PS</td>\n<td class=\"column1\"><strong>Pass</strong> is used for proficiency and special examinations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even last lastrow\"><td class=\"column0\">F</td>\n<td class=\"column1\"><strong>Failure</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Credit/No Credit Option</h4>\n<p>Students may elect to take a course under the credit/no credit option according to the following provisions:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>The student must be in good standing as defined by the chosen college.</li>\n\t<li>A maximum of 21 semester hours of credit may be earned at UIC under the credit/no credit option.

The Office of the Registrar retains a record of that letter grade in the student records system, but it is not entered on the student transcript, except as hereafter provided.</li>\n\t<li>For courses taken under the credit/no credit option, a grade of CR is recorded on the transcript if a letter grade of A, B, C, or D is earned. If the letter grade F is assigned, an NC is entered on the transcript. Grades of I and DFR are replaced by CR or NC upon completion of the courses or converted to NC if the course completion deadline for an I is not met.</li>\n\t<li>The grades of CR and NC are not used in the computation of the GPA.</li>\n\t<li>Grades of CR and NC are final and cannot be reconverted to letter grades, except under the following circumstances. If, during the student\u2019s final term prior to graduation, it is found that one or more of the courses needed to satisfy major field requirements were completed under the credit/no credit option at UIC (prior to the declaration of the major or prior to intercollegiate or intercurricular transfer), the student may elect that a sufficient number of CR grades be replaced by the originally assigned letter grades to meet major requirements. Only the minimum number of reconversions will be made. If such a minimum can be met by more than one selection of reconversions, the student may indicate a preference. This same policy applies in the case of any additional restrictions instituted by a college or school under Provision 8.</li>\n\t<li>Students must apply at their college office no later than the tenth day of the term (first Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or first Friday of Summer Session 2) to have a course designated for credit/no credit grading option.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<table role=\"presentation\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" class=\"sc_footnotes\"><tr><td valign=\"top\" class=\"symcol\">a</td><td class=\"notecol\"><p><em>Collateral courses are those courses taken outside the major department that are essential to the major and are defined as such by each college.</em></p></td></tr></table>\n<h4>Calculating the Grade Point Average (GPA)</h4>\n<p>Take the grades for each course taken and determine the grade points per hour: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Multiply the grade points per hour for each course by the number of semester hours for the course to get the grade points for each course.</li>\n\t<li>Add the grade points for each course to get the total number of grade points for the semester.</li>\n\t<li>Add the semester hours taken for each course to get the total number of semester hours.</li>\n\t<li>Divide total number of grade points for the semester by the total number of semester hours taken.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following example illustrates how to calculate the GPA.</p>\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\" class=\"sc_sctable tbl_uggpa\" summary=\"UG GPA\">\n<caption class=\"hidden noscript\">UG GPA</caption>\n<colgroup><col class=\"column0\"/><col class=\"column1\"/><col class=\"column2\"/><col class=\"column3\"/><col class=\"column4\"/><col class=\"column5\"/></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"sctablehead\">\n<th scope=\"col\" class=\"column0\">Grades</th>\n<th scope=\"col\" class=\"column1\">Grade Points/Hour</th>\n<th scope=\"col\" class=\"column2\"> </th>\n<th scope=\"col\" class=\"column3\">Semester Hours Attempted</th>\n<th scope=\"col\" class=\"column4\"> </th>\n<th scope=\"col\" class=\"column5\">Grade Points/Course</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"even firstrow\"><td class=\"column0\">A</td>\n<td class=\"column1\">4</td>\n<td class=\"column2\">X</td>\n<td class=\"column3\">4</td>\n<td class=\"column4\">=</td>\n<td class=\"column5\">16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"column0\">B</td>\n<td class=\"column1\">3</td>\n<td class=\"column2\">X</td>\n<td class=\"column3\">3</td>\n<td class=\"column4\">=</td>\n<td class=\"column5\">9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"column0\">C</td>\n<td class=\"column1\">2</td>\n<td class=\"column2\">X</td>\n<td class=\"column3\">5</td>\n<td class=\"column4\">=</td>\n<td class=\"column5\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td class=\"column0\">D</td>\n<td class=\"column1\">1</td>\n<td class=\"column2\">X</td>\n<td class=\"column3\">3</td>\n<td class=\"column4\">=</td>\n<td class=\"column5\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\"><td class=\"column0\">F</td>\n<td class=\"column1\">0</td>\n<td class=\"column2\">X</td>\n<td class=\"column3\">2</td>\n<td class=\"column4\">=</td>\n<td class=\"column5\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd last lastrow\"><td class=\"column0\"><strong>Semester Totals</strong></td>\n<td class=\"column1\"></td>\n<td class=\"column2\"></td>\n<td class=\"column3\"><strong>17</strong></td>\n<td class=\"column4\"></td>\n<td class=\"column5\"><strong>38</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The GPA for the example above is 38 divided by 17 or 2.23 on a 4.00 scale (2.23/4.00).</p>\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>Courses numbered 001\u2013099 do not carry credit toward graduation.

No student will receive a D or F on their transcript for any Spring 2020 course.</li>\n\t\t<li>The deadline for students to elect to take any course under the CR/NC option is\u00a0<u>Wednesday, April 29, 2020</u>.

Exclusions may apply to programs with licensing agency and/or accreditation board requirements and students in such programs should consult with their academic advisors.</li>\n\t\t<li>A student may
