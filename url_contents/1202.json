With degree programs in the visual arts, design, theatre and music, architecture, and art history, the college is the only place in Chicago where one can prepare for a career in the arts and design within a major research university. The college is home to an energetic, award-winning faculty of practicing architects, artists, designers, museum professionals, art historians, musicians, directors, and theatrical performers. Through their instruction and ongoing research, the faculty introduces students to disciplinary and professional themes of contemporary importance and fosters a vibrant atmosphere of intellectual and creative inquiry.</p>\n<p>The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts is a leader in visual and performing arts and design education and research in the city of Chicago, the nation, and the world. The college considers its location in Chicago\u2014a world-class cultural center, and a site of complex social realities\u2014a primary asset. It has developed partnerships with significant local museums, theaters, firms, and other cultural institutions, as well as collaborations with a wide range of programs across the university. UIC\u2019s status as an urban public institution drives the college\u2019s interest in engaging urban issues and providing access to excellence in the arts and design to diverse audiences.</p>\n<p>From this setting, the college also advances a global agenda: to break ground in the arts and arts research and to generate new knowledge, informed by both historical precedent and the use of new technologies for expression and instruction. The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts extends the traditional boundaries of research and practice in order to meet the challenges of a changing economy. Faculty and students alike realize that the next generation of graduates must be equipped to operate creatively and knowledgeably in a broadening cultural arena and to think with an international perspective. To that end, the college has attracted a number of internationally recognized faculty and developed student exchange programs in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, The Netherlands, Mexico, Russia, Sweden, and Switzerland.</p>\n<p>The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts is comprised of the School of Architecture, the School of Art &amp; Art History, the School of Design, and the School of Theatre &amp; Music, as well as the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, a National Historic Landmark and museum committed to social justice, and Gallery 400, a dynamic, cutting edge contemporary art gallery. Curricula are offered in architecture, art, art history, design, interdisciplinary education in the arts, and theatre and music, leading to the baccalaureate in those fields. The core of the architecture programs is the intensive development of design work and ideas in the studio, supported by courses in architectural theory and technology. Art and art history emphasize social and global awareness and contemporary conceptual inquiry through both visual and scholarly production. Located in the School of Art &amp; Art History, the IDEAS (Interdisciplinary Education in the Arts) BA offers students a degree linking all the arts through practice-based learning with an emphasis on emerging technology. Design programs develop sophisticated form-making skills in order to produce designers adept at formulating and advocating ideas. The School of Theatre &amp; Music provides innovative, rigorous, and comprehensive academic and performance programs as part of its diverse, urban context.</p>\n<p>All work submitted by students for credit in any course in the college belongs to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois; the university reserves the right to retain, copyright, use, exhibit, reproduce, and publish any work so submitted.</p>\n<p>For information on the <a href=\"http://cada.uic.edu\" target=\"_blank\">College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts</a>, visit the college's website.\u00a0</p>\n<h2><a id=\"b\" name=\"b\"></a>Accreditation</h2>\n<p>Qualified graduates from the Bachelor of Science in Architecture program may apply for advanced standing in the school\u2019s professional Master of Architecture degree program, or at other accredited schools of architecture. The University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s Master of Architecture program is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). Master\u2019s degree programs may consist of a preprofessional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree, which, when earned sequentially, comprise an accredited professional education. Although oriented to NAAB criteria, UIC\u2019s undergraduate preprofessional degree is not an accredited professional degree.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"c\" name=\"c\"></a>Degree Requirements</h2>\n<p>To earn a College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts degree from UIC, students need to complete university, college, and department/school degree requirements.

All courses are included, however, for determining a student\u2019s full-time/part-time status; for computing cumulative grade point averages (except for 000-level courses); and in determining probation, dismissal, and Dean\u2019s List statuses.</p>\n<h4>Elective Credit</h4>\n<p>The university, college, school, and department degree requirements may not provide all the hours required for graduation. The remaining credits are completed through elective courses, whose careful selection should serve to enrich students\u2019 knowledge and understanding. Elective courses should always be chosen for educational ends and not for the sake of convenience.</p>\n<h4>Full-Time Enrollment</h4>\n<p>Students in the college are expected to carry a full-time load in order to make satisfactory progress toward their degree. Students should consult with their academic advisor if they enroll in a part-time schedule to determine their degree progress and projected graduation date.</p>\n<h4>Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement</h4>\n<p>College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts students cannot graduate with less than a 2.00/4.00 GPA in all work taken at UIC, in all work taken in the major field, and in all work accepted for transfer by the university (transfer work plus work taken at UIC).</p>\n<h4>Graduation Declaration/Filing to Graduate</h4>\n<p>Students who are within two terms of graduation should contact the Office of Student Affairs for a complete check of their progress toward the degree. A diploma cannot be ordered until a student has completed this graduation check.</p>\n<p>Students declare their intent to graduate online using <a href=\"https://my.uic.edu\"><em>my.UIC</em></a>. The deadline for submission to the Pending Degree List is the end of the third week (fall and spring) or second week (Summer Session 2) of the term in which graduation is sought. Failure to submit the request at this time may delay the awarding of the degree. A final review will be made following the close of the term. If a student has satisfactorily completed all the degree requirements, the student\u2019s name will be placed on the official degree list.</p>\n<h4>Enrollment Residence Requirement</h4>\n<p>Either the first 90 or last 30 semester hours of degree work must be completed in continuous, uninterrupted enrollment residence at UIC. Concurrent attendance at the University of Illinois at Chicago and another collegiate institution or enrollment during the summer at another institution, when approved by the student\u2019s college, does not interrupt the UIC enrollment residence requirement for graduation. Students who transfer from an accredited community college must earn at least 60 semester hours at an approved four-year institution and must meet the enrollment residence requirement of earning the last 30 semester hours at UIC.</p>\n<h4>Transfer Credit</h4>\n<p>No more than 60 semester hours (90 quarter hours) of credit may be accepted as transfer work from a community or junior college. Transfer students from community or junior colleges should consult with an advisor in the CADA Office of Student Affairs to discuss transfer credit. All final acceptance of transfer credit will be determined by the college upon review of recommendations by the school or department.</p>\n<h4>Transfer Credit for Continuing Students</h4>\n<p>Continuing students in the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts must submit a petition to the Office in order to take courses at other universities for credit toward the baccalaureate degree.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"d\" name=\"d\"></a>College Policies</h2>\n<h3><a id=\"d1\" name=\"d1\"></a>Academic Load</h3>\n<p>During the fall and spring semesters, a full-time program is from 12 to 18 hours. Above 18 semester hours is considered an overload and may only be taken if a student is recommended by a school or department advisor and approved in the Office of Student Affairs. For Summer Session 1 (Four-Week) and Summer Session 2 (Eight-Week), UIC considers a total aggregate of 6 semester hours as the minimum number necessary to constitute full-time enrollment, and a program of more than 14 hours must be approved.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d2\" name=\"d2\"></a>Academic Probation and Dismissal Rules</h3>\n<h4>Probation Rules</h4>\n<p><strong>Academic Probation</strong>. A student whose term grade point average or UIC cumulative grade point average or combined UIC and transfer grade point average is below 2.00/4.00 is placed on academic probation and advised to enroll full-time for a minimum of 12 semester hours of credit and earn grades of B or better the next term in residence, excluding the summer session. Students unable to maintain a minimum of 12 semester hours of enrollment should consult with a college advisor to establish a plan for satisfactory progress.\u00a0Probationary status is determined by letter grades earned at the end of any term. Grades of I (Incomplete) do not exempt a student from probationary and dismissal regulations.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal Probation</strong>. A student who is on probationary status for two consecutive terms is placed on terminal probation. The student is required to make an appointment to see an advisor in the college office during the third and fourth weeks of the following semester. Students on terminal probation may be dismissed for poor academic progress and are jeopardizing their enrollment in the university.</p>\n<h4>Dismissal Rules</h4>\n<p>A student on academic or terminal probation may be dismissed from the university under one of the following conditions:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Failure to earn at least a 2.00/4.00 (C) average while on academic probation.</li>\n\t<li>Failure to meet any special conditions stated at the time of probation.</li>\n\t<li>Failure to earn at least 3 hours of credit and whose term grade point average is 1.00/4.00.</li>\n\t<li>Failure to make progress towards completion of the degree requirements of the college.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Students should follow the advice in the letter sent to them.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d4\" name=\"d4\"></a>Change of Course Schedule\u2014Dropping Courses</h3>\n<p>Undergraduate students may drop courses using <a href=\"http://www.my.uic.edu\" target=\"_blank\"><em>my.UIC</em></a> through the end of the second week of classes for fall and spring semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of Summer Session 2. During weeks 3 through 10 of the fall and spring semesters (first Thursday through the third Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), students may drop courses with the permission of their major college. If the drop occurs between 0 and 2 weeks in fall and spring, there will be no notation on the transcript. If the drop occurs during weeks 3 through 10 in fall and spring (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), a W is noted on the transcript. Undergraduate students may drop a maximum of 4 UIC individual courses that result in a W notation on their transcript during their entire undergraduate degree program. College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts students must complete a request form in the Office of Student Affairs.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d5\" name=\"d5\"></a>Change of Major</h3>\n<p>Students wishing to change majors within the college should consult an advisor and complete an application in the Office of Student Affairs.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d6\" name=\"d6\"></a>Class Attendance</h3>\n<p>Students are expected to attend all lectures, discussions, and laboratory/studio sessions.

Only the director or chairperson may waive a prerequisite, if given evidence that the student is adequately prepared to pursue the subject area.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d9\" name=\"d9\"></a>Credit/No Credit Option</h3>\n<p>Students may elect to take a course under the credit/no credit option according to the following provisions:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>The student must be in good standing. Students on probation or whose status is undetermined at the time in which they elect the option are not eligible.</li>\n\t<li>A maximum of 21 semester hours of credit may be earned at UIC under the credit/no credit option. If a student withdraws from a credit/no credit course before the end of the last day of instruction in the tenth week of the term, the semester hours the course carries will not count toward the total of 21 authorized.</li>\n\t<li>No more than one course per term may be taken under this option.</li>\n\t<li>This option may not be used in any course required for the major or a minor, including prerequisite and collateral courses. This includes any course specifically listed by rubric or course number as a requirement in a student\u2019s curriculum.</li>\n\t<li>Under certain conditions, electives may be taken under credit/no credit; courses being used for specific graduation requirements (such as art history electives) must be taken for a letter grade.

If the letter grade F is assigned, an NC is entered on the transcript. I and DF grades are replaced by CR or NC upon completion of the courses or converted to NC if the course completion deadline for an I is not met.</li>\n\t<li>The grades of CR and NC are not used in the computation of the grade point average. It is the responsibility of the student to determine eligibility under the credit/no credit option.</li>\n\t<li>Students must apply at their college office no later than the tenth day of the term (first Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or first Friday of Summer Session 2) to have a course designated for credit/no credit grading option. Students must report to the Office of Student Affairs, 208 JH to complete a credit/no credit request form.</li>\n\t<li>Students with questions concerning their eligibility should make an appointment with a college advisor.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3><a id=\"d10\" name=\"d10\"></a>Declaring a Degree</h3>\n<p>While a student may begin taking courses in the degree at any time, a student must declare a degree no later than the completion of 60 semester hours. To declare a degree, the student should consult an academic advisor in the Office of Student Affairs.\u00a0</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d11\" name=\"d11\"></a><strong>Double Major, Double Degrees, and Second Bachelor\u2019s Degree</strong></h3>\n<h4>Double Major</h4>\n<p>This option is not available in the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts.</p>\n<h4>Double Degrees</h4>\n<p>A student may receive two degrees concurrently from the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts. The student must complete a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit beyond the requirements of the first degree in courses not offered for the first degree. The student must additionally meet all the requirements for the second degree specified by the college and the major. Students seeking double degrees should contact the appropriate school or department for a curriculum evaluation and then make a declaration for double degrees in the college office.</p>\n<h4>Second Bachelor\u2019s Degree</h4>\n<p>Students who have already earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from UIC or another institution may receive a second bachelor\u2019s degree from the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts. Students seeking a second bachelor\u2019s degree must formally apply to the program. The student must complete a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit beyond the requirements of the first degree in courses not offered for the first degree. The student must additionally meet all the requirements for the second degree.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d12\" name=\"d12\"></a>Full-Time Enrollment</h3>\n<p>Students in the college are expected to carry a full-time load in order to make satisfactory progress toward their degree. Students should consult with their academic advisor if they enroll part-time to determine the consequences to their degree program and projected graduation date.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d13\" name=\"d13\"></a>Graduate-Level Courses for Undergraduate Credit</h3>\n<p>With school or department approval, an undergraduate student may enroll in a course in the Graduate College (500-level) for undergraduate elective credit. Students should obtain approval prior to enrollment.</p>\n<p>Students should understand, however, that graduate courses do not automatically apply toward an undergraduate degree. Additionally, graduate-level courses taken by an undergraduate student are generally not applicable toward a graduate degree.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d14\" name=\"d14\"></a>Independent Study</h3>\n<p>The college offers courses entitled Independent Study, in which a student\u2019s special interests may be pursued under the direction of a faculty member. To enroll in such a course, the student must obtain consent of the instructor and the school or department offering the course.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d15\" name=\"d15\"></a>Petition Procedure</h3>\n<p>Any rule, regulation, or action of the college may be appealed through the use of a student petition. Petitions are available in the Office of Student Affairs. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to obtain all necessary approvals on the form before submitting it to the Office of Student Affairs for review. Turning in the form does not guarantee approval of the request. Students will be notified of a decision, but they should inquire about the status of their petition after ten working days.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d16\" name=\"d16\"></a>Proficiency Examinations</h3>\n<p>Students interested in earning proficiency credit should contact the school or department directly for information concerning eligibility. A student who earns proficiency credit is given the amount of credit toward graduation regularly allowed in the course. Proficiency credit is not considered an interruption of enrollment residence for graduation, nor does it apply toward satisfying the minimum requirement of the degree if the last 30 semester hours must be earned in enrollment residence.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d17\" name=\"d17\"></a>Registration Approval</h3>\n<p>Students must consult with an academic advisor for registration. An advising hold may be be placed on each registration and will only be released upon verification of semester advising.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d18\" name=\"d18\"></a>Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses</h3>\n<p>Students may repeat a course to increase their knowledge of the subject matter. There are circumstances under which repeating a course is advisable and to a student\u2019s advantage. There are also circumstances where repeating a course may disadvantage a student and narrow a student\u2019s options. Some colleges require students to discuss any plan to repeat a course with their academic advisor before they register to repeat the course.</p>\n<p>Courses with A or B grades may not be repeated. Normally, courses with a C grade may not be repeated. Courses with D or F grades may be repeated once without written permission. In all cases, the original grade for the course and the grade for each repeat will appear on the transcript. The original grade and the grade for each repeat will be calculated into the grade point average.</p>\n<p>Only one registration for the course counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation. A course cannot be repeated after receiving credit in a course for which the repeat course is a prerequisite.</p>\n<p>To repeat a course more than once requires written permission from the student\u2019s college dean. Students who have been dismissed may not appeal on the grounds of intention to repeat courses. Certain courses may not be repeated; students should consult their college before repeating a course.</p>\n<h4><strong>Undergraduate Grade Point Average Recalculation Policy</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Colleges may elect to implement this policy as early as the end of the junior year, or as late as the final semester during degree certification.</li>\n\t<li>The college will evaluate each student unable to graduate because of an academic grade point average deficit. The deficit may occur in the UIC GPA, the program GPA, or both.</li>\n\t<li>The academic record is examined so as to determine if courses, deemed appropriate by each college, with grades of F or grades of D, may be excluded from the student\u2019s grade point average.</li>\n\t<li>A total of four courses may be excluded, with one course excluded at a time until the necessary quality points are obtained to meet the UIC GPA requirement and/or degree program minimum GPA. The semester hours associated with excluded course grades will not count towards graduation requirements.</li>\n\t<li>Only the college can initiate course exclusions, and only in consultation with the evaluated student.</li>\n\t<li>Students may not request exclusions.</li>\n\t<li>Only courses taken at UIC may be converted as part of this policy.</li>\n\t<li>This policy only applies to undergraduate degree seeking students.</li>\n\t<li>All courses taken and all grades will remain on the official transcript.</li>\n\t<li>The grade exclusion policy does not apply to courses failed as the result of a student conduct hearing.</li>\n\t<li>In cases where these procedures would impact program accreditation, licensure or similar, colleges may use their discretion to allow the policy. Colleges, departments, and programs may have discretion in choosing courses that impact the student\u2019s major.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a id=\"d19\" name=\"d19\"></a>Transferring</h3>\n<h4>Intercollege Transfer Students</h4>\n<p>UIC students interested in admission to one of the degree offered in the college must complete an intercollegiate application available in the Office of Student Affairs.
