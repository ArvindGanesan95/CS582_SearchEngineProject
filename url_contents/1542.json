The university expects students to follow the degree requirements and academic policies outlined in this publication. Students choose their degree programs, select and register for courses each term, and track their progress toward degree completion. In return, UIC provides students with a range of resources that are useful for academic planning, completing course requirements, and remaining on track for graduation. Many of these academic planning resources can be accessed online using the portal <em><a href=\"http://my.uic.edu\" target=\"_blank\">my.UIC</a></em>.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"a1\" name=\"a1\"></a>Essential Online Resources for Students</h3>\n<h4>Transferology</h4>\n<p>Transferology works in conjunction with uAchieve, the university degree audit system, to create transfer planning guides. Transferology planning guides assist prospective students by providing current information about how transfer credit is applied to specific UIC undergraduate degree programs. Students can create Transferology accounts through the <a href=\"http://www.transferology.com\" target=\"_blank\">Transferology website</a>.</p>\n<p>Current UIC students should contact their college advising office for information on transfer credit restrictions prior to enrolling in courses at other institutions.</p>\n<h4>uAchieve Degree Audit</h4>\n<p>uAchieve produces a degree audit intended for use within the university to facilitate advisement and to monitor progress toward undergraduate program completion. The degree audit identifies all components of the student\u2019s chosen degree program, indicates how requirements have been met, and provides lists of approved courses from which the student may choose to fulfill remaining requirements.</p>\n<p>Students should review a degree audit each semester through uAchieve and consult with an advisor each semester to select courses for the following semester. The uAchieve interface is accessed through the <a href=\"http://my.uic.edu\" target=\"_blank\"><em>my.UIC</em></a> portal on the Degree Audit tab.</p>\n<h4>Online Catalog and Course Descriptions</h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat\" target=\"_blank\"><em>2019\u20132021 Undergraduate Catalog</em></a> is online in html and PDF formats. The html version is updated regularly as degree programs, courses, and requirements change. The PDF version remains static as degree programs and requirements change.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/course-descriptions\">Course descriptions</a> are in the online catalog. The <em>Schedule of Classes</em>, a listing of courses for each term, can be accessed through <em><a href=\"http://my.uic.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">my.UIC</a>.</em></p>\n<h3><a id=\"a2\" name=\"a2\"></a>Planning for Academic Success</h3>\n<p>Planning for academic success begins early. To earn a degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago, students need to make thoughtful decisions about course selection each term; fulfill the degree requirements outlined by the university, college, and, if applicable, the department or school; and demonstrate competence in all courses according to university and college standards.</p>\n<p>New students are often surprised by the transition to college academic life. For the first time, students are wholly responsible for their own success. Going to classes, doing the work, and understanding the concepts are up to the student. Selecting courses, meeting degree requirements, and following academic policies are the students\u2019 responsibility. Asking questions, identifying problems, and seeking advice or help when necessary are a student\u2019s prerogative. Students will find knowledgeable, caring faculty and advisors across campus ready to help with these and other concerns; all they have to do is ask.</p>\n<p>Many first year students are undecided about a major. It is possible to be undecided and make progress toward a degree, but it requires careful planning with the help of an advisor. Similarly, a large number of students discover along the way that they would like to change majors. UIC offers a wide array of undergraduate degree programs to satisfy most academic interests. Students should discuss the options with an advisor before making a final decision. Advisors can help students identify degree programs of interest, entrance requirements, and degree requirements that have already been met.</p>\n<p>Many students begin college with the goal of graduating in four years. To graduate in four years, students need to take at least 15 hours per semester. Whether or not a course load of 15 or more semester hours is manageable depends on several factors, including the difficulty of particular courses and degree programs, outside commitments like work and family, and individual learning styles. Academic advisors can help students set reasonable goals based upon individual circumstances. Before making the decision to extend graduation beyond four years, students should also meet with a financial aid counselor to discuss the impact of such a decision on the total cost of education and financial support.</p>\n<p>Students should keep the following tips in mind as they plan for academic success:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Maintain files of relevant paper and electronic university correspondence, uAchieve degree audits, academic planning worksheets, and other important documentation pertaining to enrollment at UIC.</li>\n\t<li>Meet with an advisor once a semester or more frequently as necessary.</li>\n\t<li>Attend instructors\u2019 office hours to ask questions about lecture material, course readings, and assignments.</li>\n\t<li>Use the University Library system, including working with undergraduate librarians, to complete course requirements and build important research skills.</li>\n\t<li>Take advantage of tutoring.</li>\n\t<li>Go to every class.</li>\n\t<li>Be realistic about academic goals.</li>\n\t<li>Consider all the factors impacting a manageable course load as well as the four-year tuition guarantee and plan accordingly. For instance, plan on summer session courses if not taking a course load of 15 or more hours per semester.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a id=\"a3\" name=\"a3\"></a>Academic Advising</h3>\n<h4>Academic Advising Mission Statement</h4>\n<p>The mission of academic advising at the University of Illinois at Chicago is to ensure successful undergraduate educational experiences. Academic advising is centered in the colleges. The larger advising network assists students with making the transition to college life and guides their informed decisions about the academic priorities, progress, and goals integral to completing degrees and preparing for careers.</p>\n<h4>Identifying the Advisor and Scheduling Appointments</h4>\n<p>Academic advisors are professional staff and faculty members who assist students with course selection, scheduling, degree requirements, administrative requirements, the interpretation of rules and regulations, and the utilization of campus resources. Academic advising is available to all UIC students. Academic advising at UIC is decentralized, which means that it occurs in the major college or department. Students can learn more about academic advising at UIC by visiting the <a href=\"http://advising.uic.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Office for Advising Development's website</a>.</p>\n<p>Students should plan to meet with an academic advisor each term. The following guidelines are offered to help students make the most of advising appointments:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Schedule appointments well in advance of registration.</li>\n\t<li>Examine degree requirements, course descriptions, and the <em>Schedule of Classes</em> prior to the advising appointment.</li>\n\t<li>Develop a tentative schedule before meeting with an advisor.</li>\n\t<li>Ask for clarification on issues pertaining to scheduling, degree requirements, course selection, academic policies, or anything else that may impact academic progress.</li>\n\t<li>Review a uAchieve degree audit outlining progress toward the degree at each advising appointment.</li>\n\t<li>Keep track of progress toward the degree and review records with the advisor. Advisors assist students with this process, but it is the students\u2019 responsibility to make sure that all degree requirements are met.</li>\n\t<li>Be aware of <em>Change of Course Schedule (Drop/Add)</em> rules and rules on <em>Withdrawal</em> from classes.</li>\n\t<li>Stay informed of rules governing <em><a href=\"/ucat/admissions-registration-finances/financial-aid/#sap\">Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid</a></em>, which may be found in the <em>Financial Aid</em> section of the catalog. Do not drop courses or withdraw without considering these rules and consulting a financial aid advisor if receiving financial aid.</li>\n\t<li>Remember that advisors provide students with understanding and clarification of the options available, but students make their own decisions.</li>\n\t<li>Make the best possible decisions by consulting the catalog, a uAchieve degree audit, and an advisor prior to course selection, registration, and enrollment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students should consult their college section of the catalog for specific information on academic advising through the college or department.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"b\" name=\"b\"></a>University Library</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://library.uic.edu\" target=\"_blank\">http://library.uic.edu</a></p>\n<h3><a id=\"b1\" name=\"b1\"></a>Richard J.

Enrolling in summer courses is a good way for students to catch up or get ahead in their academic studies, or manage a heavy course load during the fall or spring. UIC offers students two summer sessions, Summer Session 1 (4-week session) followed by Summer Session 2 (8-week session). Students can enroll in courses in one or a combination of both. Although the summer sessions are shorter in length, all courses offered in the summer are worth the same number of semester hours as the same courses in the fall or spring. UIC students interested in taking advantage of summer session courses should discuss their plans with their college advisor.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d1\" name=\"d1\"></a>Continuing UIC Students and Summer Session</h3>\n<p>Continuing UIC students register for summer in the same way as they do for fall or spring. In the spring, all eligible, continuing UIC students will be notified as to when they can view their Time Ticket online for summer and fall registration. The Time Ticket shows the earliest date and time that a student may register. As a general rule, undergraduate students may take up to 12 semester hours over the summer without special approval\u2014either as a combination of courses taken in the 4-week and 8-week sessions, or just courses taken in the 8-week session.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d2\" name=\"d2\"></a>Visiting Students and Summer Session</h3>\n<p>Visiting students who want to take undergraduate courses at UIC during the summer only and who do not intend to continue at UIC in the fall should apply using the Summer Session Only application. Please see the Summer Session website for further information on admission criteria and the application process. Summer Session Only students are admitted as nondegree students and are eligible to register for summer classes. Summer Session Only students may register online during Open Registration for summer, (check the Summer Session website for exact dates). As a general rule, Summer Session Only students may take up to 12 semester hours without special approval\u2014either as a combination of courses taken in the 4-week and 8-week sessions, or just courses taken in the 8-week session.</p>\n<p>Additional information about the UIC Summer Session can be found on the <a href=\"http://summer.uic.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Summer Session website</a> or by contacting the Summer Session Office at (312) 996-9099.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"f\" name=\"f\"></a>Study Abroad Office</h2>\n<p>502 University Hall (UH)<br/>\n(312) 413-7662<br/>\n<a href=\"http://studyabroad.uic.edu\" target=\"_blank\">http://studyabroad.uic.edu</a></p>\n<p>With a focus on supporting as many students as possible in becoming effective and influential leaders in civil society, the Study Abroad Office strives to internationalize the curriculum through program opportunities on six continents; engage UIC\u2019s highly diverse student population to become intentional learners with increased global awareness; and assure student access to scholarship and grant support for an international academic experience.</p>\n<p>Students may participate in a summer, semester, or yearlong academic experience by selecting from more than 200 programs in over 50 countries on six continents across all academic disciplines.

Completion of the program leads to a commission in the U.S. Army. The Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) is open to all eligible full-time students, both male and female. A total of 32 semester hours of academic credit is available and is potentially applicable to graduation requirements as elective credit. The curriculum is centered\u00a0on an applied leadership training program which is designed to develop personal traits and qualities essential to successful leadership in civilian life as well as the military environment.</p>\n<p>ROTC basic courses are available to all students as an elective. Requirements for enrollment in the Advanced Course and to pursue a commission as an Army officer are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>United States citizenship (legal residents may enroll in the Advanced Course, but must obtain citizenship prior to commissioning).</li>\n\t<li>Full-time student in good academic standing.</li>\n\t<li>Medically qualified for commissioning.</li>\n\t<li>Physically fit enough to pass the Army Physical Fitness Test and Water Survival Test.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A student entering the university with successful completion of military training in high school at an accredited Junior ROTC program is entitled, upon enrollment, to higher placement as determined by the professor of military science. Instruction is offered through four-year and two-year programs. The four-year program consists of the Basic Course (first two years) and the Advanced Course (last two years). Cadets are issued, at no cost, uniforms and equipment necessary for the ROTC program.</p>\n<h4>Basic Course</h4>\n<p>The basic course, normally completed during the freshman and sophomore years, provides the student with a general knowledge of the military\u2019s role in society and the missions of the Army.\u00a0Subjects include leadership, land navigation, marksmanship, military history, and basic military skills.\u00a0Students enroll in one military science course each semester.\u00a0Additionally, a weekend field training exercise is required each semester.\u00a0It is possible for a sophomore to complete the basic course in one year through prior arrangement with the department.
