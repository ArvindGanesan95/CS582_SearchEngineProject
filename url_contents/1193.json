programs and courses in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. The offerings of LAS contribute to the educational quality, breadth, and vitality of UIC. The tradition of the liberal arts emphasizes holistic intellectual development rather than vocational and professional training. An understanding of human cultures, the natural universe, and social sciences provides the foundation for comprehending the complex and evolving world in which we live.</p>\n<p>LAS undergraduate degree programs encompass a broad-based general education experience, a student-selected field of specialization, and elective courses to round out a student\u2019s interests. Students are encouraged to participate in faculty-led research and scholarly opportunities, as well as internships and study abroad. Graduates are prepared to pursue nearly any career path and further education.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"b\" name=\"b\"></a>Degree Requirements</h2>\n<p>To earn a College of Liberal Arts and Sciences degree from UIC, students need to complete university, college, and department degree requirements.</p>\n<p>Changes to graduation requirements and related policies are announced online. If requirements are changed, continuing students in LAS and those whose attendance at UIC has been interrupted for no more than two years may complete the current graduation requirements or may continue to meet those requirements in effect at the time of initial registration in the college. Students who return to UIC after an absence of more than two years are responsible for meeting the requirements of the university and college as well as of the major or curriculum in effect at the time of the student\u2019s reenrollment. For all students, however, if courses originally required are no longer offered or if external accrediting or certifying agencies modify their requirements, the college or department will specify substitutes.</p>\n<p>University and college degree requirements for all College of Liberal Arts and Sciences students are outlined below. Students should consult their department section for additional degree requirements.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"b1\" name=\"b1\"></a>Semester Hour Requirement</h3>\n<p>Each of the degree programs listed below

Therefore, all LAS undergraduate students shall, in their first year, register for courses that satisfy the University Writing and Quantitative Reasoning requirements, or for such preparatory courses as may be indicated by placement tests, and shall continue to register in such courses until the requirements have been satisfied. Students who fail to follow these guidelines will be subject to academic probation and other sanctions. The remaining course requirements, with the exception of the Writing-in-the-Discipline requirement, should be completed as early in the college career as feasible.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The table below outlines LAS General Education and Writing-in-the-Discipline requirements.

The following General Education Core requirements for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences satisfy the University\u2019s minimum requirements. Students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences are required to take a total of nine courses. Of those, seven are prescribed: two laboratory courses in Analyzing the Natural World and one course in each of the other five categories. The remaining two courses may be chosen freely from among any of the six categories.</p>\n<p>Students who register for a course that is listed in more than one category will have the flexibility of deciding which category the course will satisfy. They do not have to decide right away but may wait to see how their plan of study develops over time. The course, however, will fulfill the requirement of only one category. In other words, the course will not satisfy the requirement of two categories just because it is listed in two categories.</p>\n<p>The General Education Core categories are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Analyzing the Natural World</li>\n\t<li>Understanding the Individual and Society</li>\n\t<li>Understanding the Past</li>\n\t<li>Understanding the Creative Arts</li>\n\t<li>Exploring World Cultures</li>\n\t<li>Understanding U.S. Society</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a description and list of courses for each General Education Core category, students should consult the <a href=\"/ucat/degree-programs/general-education/\"><em>General Education</em></a> section of the catalog.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>Up to two courses in the major may count toward fulfillment of General Education Core requirements. Students should see their department sections to determine if their major includes any approved General Education Core courses.</p>\n<h4>General Education Proficiencies\u2014Foreign Language Requirement, Quantitative Reasoning Requirement, and University Writing Requirement</h4>\n<h5>Foreign Language Requirement</h5>\n<p>The basic requirement is proficiency in a language that has a recognized literature or culture. The level of proficiency must be the equivalent of that expected of the student who has completed the elementary and intermediate levels of language study (i.e., the first two years) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Students studying foreign language at UIC are strongly encouraged to register for required language courses in consecutive semesters until the requirement is met. Students may satisfy the requirement in any one of several ways:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>By presenting qualifying scores on Advanced Placement examinations in foreign language, a qualifying score on a UIC foreign language placement test, appropriate course work as awarded per the State Seal of Biliteracy, or other authorized proficiency test for languages not offered at UIC.</li>\n\t<li>By transferring credit for two years of a single language at the college level. With college approval, a student transferring from another university or another UIC college who has never been enrolled in LAS, who is admitted with senior standing and who has not satisfied the language requirement may do so by passing one course in a language sequence during each term in enrollment residence at UIC. Seniors admitted with foreign language transfer credit must consult a dean for application of this rule.</li>\n\t<li>By completing four semesters of language courses at UIC. The college currently offers complete sequences in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Polish, Russian, and Spanish.</li>\n\t<li>By completing a partial sequence of language courses as determined by the results of a placement test or placement by a language department. The college determines eligibility for credit in a recommended course.</li>\n\t<li>By presenting evidence of secondary education completed in a country where the language of instruction was other than English. No elementary- or intermediate-level course or proficiency credit will be given for that language. The language requirement, however, will be considered fulfilled only if the student consults a dean for application of this rule and receives conditional approval.</li>\n\t<li>By transferring four semesters of credit in American Sign Language courses from an accredited U.S. college or university. Courses must include the study of deaf culture.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Quantitative Reasoning Requirement</h5>\n<p>Students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences must demonstrate competency in quantitative reasoning to earn a degree. Such competence can be demonstrated in any one of the following ways:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Achievement of a score on the mathematics placement examination high enough to qualify for enrollment in <span class=\"sc_courseinline\"><a href=\"/search/?P=MATH%20180\" title=\"MATH\u00a0180\" class=\"bubblelink code\" onclick=\"return showCourse(this, 'MATH 180');\">MATH\u00a0180</a></span>.

A required Writing-in-the-Discipline course is included in each degree program.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"b3\" name=\"b3\"></a>Other Requirements</h3>\n<h4>Course Level Requirement</h4>\n<p>A student must earn a minimum of 40 semester hours in advanced-level courses (those numbered 200 and above at UIC) at any accredited four-year college or university. At least 12 semester hours of these 40 advanced hours must be taken in the major field while in residence at UIC. Community college work, regardless of the course number or level, is not considered advanced for the purposes of this requirement.\u00a0</p>\n<h4>Course Work Limitations</h4>\n<p>Course work completed at UIC and other accredited institutions is not automatically applicable toward graduation requirements. The final decision regarding the acceptance of credit and courses that apply toward degree requirements is made by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Course work considered by the college office as nonbaccalaureate or remedial is not accepted toward the degree. Course work that duplicates previous work is counted toward graduation, whereas the original course work does not count. No credit is given for a course in which a failing grade was received.</p>\n<p>The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences restricts degree credit as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The college allows a maximum of three semester hours of personal training and physical fitness credit including the following 100-level UIC courses; <span class=\"sc_courseinline\"><a href=\"/search/?P=KN%20130\" title=\"KN\u00a0130\" class=\"bubblelink code\" onclick=\"return showCourse(this, 'KN 130');\">KN\u00a0130</a></span>,\u00a0<span class=\"sc_courseinline\"><a href=\"/search/?P=KN%20136\" title=\"KN\u00a0136\" class=\"bubblelink code\" onclick=\"return showCourse(this, 'KN 136');\">KN\u00a0136</a></span>, <span class=\"sc_courseinline\"><a href=\"/search/?P=KN%20137\" title=\"KN\u00a0137\" class=\"bubblelink code\" onclick=\"return showCourse(this, 'KN 137');\">KN\u00a0137</a></span>, <span class=\"sc_courseinline\"><a href=\"/search/?P=KN%20194\" title=\"KN\u00a0194\" class=\"bubblelink code\" onclick=\"return showCourse(this, 'KN 194');\">KN\u00a0194</a></span>.</li>\n\n\t<li>Students may earn a maximum of three semester hours of 100-level Military Science and Naval Science courses. An additional one hour of credit in basic military science is allowed for students who have served for a minimum of six months of extended active duty in any branch of the armed forces for the United States.</li>\n\t<li>Credit in individual performance courses is limited to 8 semester hours.</li>\n\t<li>No credit is given for doctrinal and canonical course work taken in seminaries or any other institution that provides religious or sectarian training.</li>\n\t<li>No more than 16 semester hours of independent study may apply toward the degree. The maximum degree credit in independent study in an individual department or program is 8 semester hours. Fieldwork and internship courses that are formally required for the major are excluded from this limitation.</li>\n\t<li>A maximum of 24 semester hours in courses offered by other UIC colleges and acceptable by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences may be applicable toward the degree. Transfer courses from other liberal arts colleges must be equivalent to those offered by other UIC colleges to be acceptable. In cases where majors, minors, and curricula require courses not offered in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the student may take no more than 24 hours of non-LAS courses in addition to those non-LAS courses required for the program.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Elective Credit</h4>\n<p>Together, the major and LAS course requirements generally do not provide the entire 120 semester hours required for graduation. Known as electives, those hours remaining should serve to enrich a student\u2019s educational background either through work allied to the major or in courses that can generally increase knowledge and understanding. Elective courses should always be chosen by a student for educational reasons, not simply for convenience or for semester hours.</p>\n<h4>Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement</h4>\n<p>A student must earn a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00/4.00 in all work taken at UIC. In addition, the combined average of a student\u2019s transfer work and work taken at UIC must be at least 2.00. A minimum grade point average of 2.00 is required for all courses in the major field. In addition, the combined average of transfer work and work taken at UIC in all courses in the major field must be at least 2.00. Some majors may require a higher grade point average. Failure to maintain the required minimum grade point average in the major may result in the student's dismissal from that major.</p>\n<h4>Graduation Declaration/Filing to Graduate</h4>\n<p>Students declare their intent to graduate online using <a href=\"http://my.UIC.edu\" target=\"_blank\"><em>my.UIC</em></a>. Students who do not have access to <a href=\"http://my.UIC.edu\" target=\"_blank\"><em>my.UIC</em> </a>should contact the LAS Student Academic Affairs Office to file the Intent to Graduate form. The deadline for submission to the Pending Degree List is the end of the third week (fall and spring) or second week (Summer Session 2) of the term in which graduation is sought. Failure to submit the request at this time may delay the awarding of the degree. A final review will be made following the close of the term. If a student has satisfactorily completed all the degree requirements, the student\u2019s name will be placed on the official degree list.</p>\n<p>The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences reserves the right to recommend the awarding of a degree once degree requirements have been fulfilled without prior request or approval of the student.</p>\n<h4><a id=\"Enrollment-Residence-Requirement\" name=\"Enrollment-Residence-Requirement\"></a>Enrollment Residence Requirement</h4>\n<p>For the major, a student must complete at least one-half of the course work required for the major, excluding collateral course requirements, in enrollment residence at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The major course work completed in residence must include at least 12 semester hours at the advanced level.</p>\n<p>For all course work, either the first 90 semester hours or the last 30 semester hours of degree work must be completed in continuous, uninterrupted enrollment residence at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Concurrent attendance at the University of Illinois at Chicago and another collegiate institution, or enrollment during the summer at another institution, when approved by the student\u2019s college, does not interrupt the UIC enrollment residence requirement.</p>\n<p>Course work taken at the Springfield and Urbana-Champaign campuses of the University of Illinois does not satisfy these residence requirements. Credit earned through proficiency examinations including the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), UIC extension courses, and Urbana-Champaign distance-learning courses does not apply toward the minimum 30-semester-hour enrollment residence requirement. Study abroad and distance-learning courses that have been approved by the student\u2019s major department and by the college are not considered an interruption of enrollment residence for students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>\n<h4>60-hour Requirement</h4>\n<p>At a minimum, 60 semester hours are required at the University of Illinois at Chicago or any other accredited four-year college or university. Additionally, students must complete the enrollment residency requirement to graduate (see Enrollment Residence Requirement).</p>\n<h4>Transfer Credit</h4>\n<p>Course work completed at other colleges and universities may apply toward partial fulfillment of graduation requirements and may be used as prerequisites for courses at UIC. The University of Illinois at Chicago is a participant in the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI), a statewide agreement that allows for the transfer of the IAI-approved General Education Core Curriculum between participating institutions. Please consult <a href=\"/ucat/admissions-registration-finances/admissions/#IAI\"><em>Illinois Articulation Initiative </em></a>in the<em> Admissions </em>section of the catalog. The final decision, however, regarding the acceptance of credit and courses that apply toward degree requirements is made by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>\n<p>Students who transfer course work may anticipate some loss of credit. This might require more time to complete the degree than had been originally planned. When the loss of credit occurs, it does not imply a negative evaluation of a student\u2019s transfer work but rather a lack of appropriateness for the programs of the college. Attendance at new transfer student orientation is strongly encouraged as an individualized assessment of progress-to-degree and appropriate course selection will be reviewed. New transfer students who are unable to attend orientation are required to complete an advising appointment before or during their first term to ensure continued enrollment. For more information regarding the transferability of credits prospective students may create an account at <a href=\"https://www.transferology.com\" target=\"_blank\">Transferology</a>.</p>\n<h4>Transfer Credit for Continuing Students</h4>\n<p>Continuing students who want to take course work for credit at another institution, either concurrent with UIC enrollment or during the summer term, must obtain prior approval from their assigned advisor and, where appropriate, the relevant department to ensure the transferability of course work.\u00a0<span>Students are obligated to report all work from other institutions once enrolled at UIC. 60 hours at a four-year school are required for graduation</span><span>\u00a0(see 60-hour Requirement). Additionally, students must complete the enrollment residency requirement to graduate (see Enrollment Residency Requirement). \u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><a id=\"SecondaryEducationRequirements\" name=\"SecondaryEducationRequirements\"></a>Secondary Education Program Requirements</h3>\n<p>Students who are preparing to teach at the secondary level enroll in programs supervised by the departments offering the various majors. These programs, which have state approval and differ in some respects from those of the arts and sciences programs, prepare the student for State of Illinois licensure.</p>\n<p>Completion of a secondary education curriculum leads to either the Bachelor of Arts or the Bachelor of Science in the teaching of the field of specialization. The choice of a major determines the particular degree that will be awarded. Those who complete a secondary education curriculum may not pursue a second major or curriculum; only secondary education majors may elect a teacher education minor or endorsement. A student must choose a major field from the following academic disciplines: English, French, German, History, Mathematics, or Spanish. Detailed information is available in the <a href=\"catalog.uic.edu/ucat/colleges-depts/education\"><em>College of Education</em> section of the catalog</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<h4>Secondary Licensure</h4>\n<p>Students interested in completing the approved program leading to licensure at the secondary level should consult the College of Education. For information on licensure, consult the <a href=\"http://cte.uic.edu\">Council on Teacher Education</a>.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"c\" name=\"c\"></a>College Policies</h2>\n<p>All students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, whether enrolled as full-time, part-time, nondegree, or visitor, are subject to all rules of the college.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"c1\" name=\"c1\"></a>Academic Load</h3>\n<p>In the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, students may enroll in either a part-time or full-time program of study, in either day or evening classes. During the fall and spring semesters, a minimum full-time program is 12 semester hours, however 14\u201316 hours are recommended. A program of 19 semester hours or more must be approved by a college dean or academic advisor. For Summer Session 1 (four-week) and Summer Session 2 (eight-week), UIC considers a total aggregate of 6 semester hours (5 hours for graduate students) as the minimum number necessary to constitute full-time enrollment. A program of 13 semester hours or more during the summer session must be approved by a college dean or academic advisor.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"c2\" name=\"c2\"></a>Academic Probation and Dismissal Rules</h3>\n<h4>Deficit Points and Academic Recovery</h4>\n<p>To better understand probation, dismissal, and academic recovery, \u00a0it is important to understand deficit points.\u00a0Students who have\u00a0earned\u00a0a UIC total GPA below a 2.00 will have negative deficit points.\u00a0<span>Deficit points are calculated as follows: multiply the number of semester hours for each course taken by the points for the grade received,\u00a0A=+2, B=+1, C=0, D=-1, F=-2. Add the points for each course taken during the semester. The total equals the deficit points used to determine probation status\u00a0</span>and<span>\u00a0dismissal. </span><span>For every negative deficit point earned, an equivalent in\u00a0</span>positive<span>\u00a0points must be earned to offset the negative, returning the GPA to 2.00 and good academic standing. As an example, students with -14 deficit would need a subsequent semester of 14 semester hours of B\u00a0</span>grades, with nothing less than a C in order to return to good standing. Student's degree audit report found in <a href=\"https://my.uic.edu/uPortal/f/welcome/normal/render.uP\">uAchieve</a>\u00a0detail academic deficit, semester, and total GPAs. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<h4>Probation Rules</h4>\n<p>A student will be placed on academic probation in any term in which either their UIC total or semester grade point average (GPA) is less than 2.00/4.00. The probation rules apply to all College of Liberal Arts and Sciences students. Academic probation at UIC cannot be removed by course work from other colleges or universities, including programs of the Springfield and Urbana-Champaign campuses.</p>\n<p>A student who earned probation as the result of a semester GPA below a 2.00, but has a UIC total GPA above a 2.00, must earn a 2.00 GPA the following term to regain good academic standing. Probation students with a UIC total GPA below a 2.00 must earn equal to or greater than a 2.00 during their next term. It is required that students reach a UIC total GPA greater than or equal to a 2.00 GPA to graduate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In an effort to ensure progress-to-degree, the college may prohibit continued enrollment in areas where the student consistently fails to meet minimum academic standards. The college will notify the student of these limitations in the form of an academic contract which will be enforced through the use of an academic progress hold.\u00a0<span>For assistance in choosing a major, see </span><a href=\"#Major Exploration and Career Development\"><em>Major Exploration and Career Developmen</em>t</a><span>. Additionally, t</span><span>he college may require additional mandatory advising and the creation of a success plan to ensure continued enrollment and positive progress-to-degree. \u00a0</span></p>\n<h4>Dismissal Rules</h4>\n<p>The college is greatly concerned with student success and occasionally must take steps to encourage a student to remediate academic deficits and/or reevaluate their commitment to higher education. After careful consideration of a student's ability to recover from academic difficulty, the college may elect to academically dismiss a student and cancel their continuing student status.</p>\n<p><span>\u00a0In any term, a student may be dismissed for one or more of the following reasons:</span></p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>First-term students will be dismissed after their first term of enrollment if they earn zero credit, a grade point average of less than 1.00/4.00, or obtain a deficit of -15 points or more.\u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Continuing students will be dismissed at the end of any term in which their deficit points are -15 or more.</li>\n\t<li>Failure to earn any credit.</li>\n\t<li>Failure to earn at least a 2.00/4.00 GPA while on probation.</li>\n\t<li>Failure to meet conditions of an academic contract.</li>\n\t<li>Failure to meet conditions specified at the time of admission.</li>\n\t<li>Failure to make progress toward completion of an LAS degree.</li>\n\t<li>Two or more consecutive terms of university withdrawals.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Appeal of a Dismissal Decision</h4>\n<p>Students who have been dismissed may apply for readmission after two terms (excluding the summer session), applications originate at the office of admissions. It is important to note, that students are afforded 15 weeks to complete a term withdrawal, available online, through the last day of instruction.\u00a0<span>In the event that a serious health or personal issue prevented the student from completing the online term withdrawal by the deadline, or extenuating circumstances prevented the student from completing finals,\u00a0students will have the limited opportunity to meet with a Dean or LAS Student Affairs Administrator in the LAS Advising Center to petition for immediate reinstatement.\u00a0</span><span>The student may request immediate reinstatement by following the guidelines as outlined in the college dismissal letter. Students may access their letter via https://student.las.uic.edu.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><a id=\"c3\" name=\"c3\"></a>Change of Course Schedule</h3>\n<h4>Adding Courses</h4>\n<p>Students may add courses for which they have met the prerequisite(s) if seats are still available during the first two weeks of the fall and spring semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of Summer Session 2. Students should seek approval of the instructor to enroll in a class after the fifth day of the semester since some courses prohibit enrollment during the second week in accordance with college policy.</p>\n<p>The deadline for adding or switching sections of <span class=\"sc_courseinline\"><a href=\"/search/?P=ENGL%20160\" title=\"ENGL\u00a0160\" class=\"bubblelink code\" onclick=\"return showCourse(this, 'ENGL 160');\">ENGL\u00a0160</a></span> and <span class=\"sc_courseinline\"><a href=\"/search/?P=ENGL%20161\" title=\"ENGL\u00a0161\" class=\"bubblelink code\" onclick=\"return showCourse(this, 'ENGL 161');\">ENGL\u00a0161</a></span> is the end of Week 1 of the semester. After Week 1, adding or switching sections of these courses is not permitted.</p>\n\n<h4>Dropping Courses</h4>\n<p>Undergraduate students may drop courses using <em><a href=\"http://my.UIC.edu\" target=\"_blank\">my.UIC</a></em> through the end of the second week of classes for fall and spring semesters, or through the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1 and the first Friday of Summer Session 2. During weeks 3 through 10 of the fall and spring semesters (first Thursday through the third Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), students may drop courses with the permission of the college. If the drop occurs between 0\u20132 weeks in fall and spring, there will be no notation on the transcript. If the drop occurs during weeks 3 through 10 in fall and spring, a W is noted on the transcript. During their entire undergraduate degree program, undergraduate students may drop a maximum of four UIC individual courses that result in a W notation on their transcript. These drop requests are approved, regardless of the circumstances, provided that the student meets with an LAS academic advisor or dean within the designated period and that the student has not exceeded the limit of four late drops. The merits of the student\u2019s request are not a factor in determining eligibility to late drop.</p>\n<p>Because only four exceptions to the designated deadlines are available to students over the entire period in which they are enrolled at UIC, students are advised to evaluate their academic standing in the course with the instructor before requesting to exercise one of these four late drops.</p>\n<p>Requests to drop a course after the tenth week of the fall and spring semesters, or requests to drop a course within the approved exception period in excess of the four automatic drops are not routinely granted unless there are exceptional circumstances outside of the student\u2019s control that can be documented. Requests must include a written petition and are reviewed by the committee on petitions. Poor performance in a course is not a sufficient reason to approve a request. Students may inquire about the petition process by contacting their LAS assigned academic advisor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Course drop deadlines that apply to summer sessions are announced by the <a href=\"https://registrar.uic.edu/registration/policies_procedures.html\" target=\"_blank\">Office of the Registrar</a> on its website.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"c4\" name=\"c4\"></a>Change of Major</h3>\n<p><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW76144177 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW76144177\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">Students seeking to change or add a major should declare the new major with the department offering that major</span></span><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW76144177 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW76144177\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">\u00a0(see\u00a0</span></span><a href=\"#c9\"><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW76144177 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 CommentStart NormalTextRun SCXW76144177\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">Declaring a Major</span></span></a><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW76144177 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW76144177\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">)</span></span><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW76144177 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW76144177\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">.

Students on probation and those whose status is undetermined at the time at which they elect the option are not eligible.</li>\n\t<li>\u00a0A student may request only one course per term as credit/no credit.</li>\n\t<li>No more than two courses in a single discipline may be taken as credit/no credit.</li>\n\t<li>Only elective courses may be taken on a credit/no credit basis; courses being used to meet any graduation course requirements must be taken for letter grades.</li>\n\t<li>The following describes the restrictions that apply to all students, regardless of major or curriculum:\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Students may not take <span class=\"sc_courseinline\"><a href=\"/search/?P=ENGL%20160\" title=\"ENGL\u00a0160\" class=\"bubblelink code\" onclick=\"return showCourse(this, 'ENGL 160');\">ENGL\u00a0160</a></span> or <span class=\"sc_courseinline\"><a href=\"/search/?P=ENGL%20161\" title=\"ENGL\u00a0161\" class=\"bubblelink code\" onclick=\"return showCourse(this, 'ENGL 161');\">ENGL\u00a0161</a></span> as credit/no credit.</li>\n\n\t\t<li>Students may not take any course used to satisfy the foreign language requirement as credit/no credit.</li>\n\t\t<li>Students may not take any course used to satisfy the General Education Core requirements as credit/no credit. Until students have completed the minimum requirement in each General Education Core category, courses from these areas may not be taken as credit/no credit.</li>\n\t\t<li>Students may not take any course used to satisfy the Quantitative Reasoning requirement as credit/no credit.</li>\n\t\t<li>Students may not take any course being used to satisfy the requirements of the major, minor, or the required prerequisite and collateral courses of the major as credit/no credit.</li>\n\t\t<li>Students in the health sciences curricula are advised not to complete required science courses under the credit/no credit option.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\n\t</li>\n\n\t<li>A student may earn no more than 21 semester hours of credit at UIC under the credit/no credit option.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Students must apply to take a course credit/no credit at the college office, third floor, University Hall, no later than the tenth day of the term (first Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or first Friday of Summer Session 2). After that date, students may not request courses on a credit/no credit basis nor may they change a credit/no credit request previously submitted. It is the responsibility of the student to determine eligibility under the regulations. Students requesting a course under the credit/no credit option will be informed if they are ineligible and will receive a grade for the course. Students with questions concerning their eligibility should make an appointment with a college advisor. Instructors are not informed that a student has elected this option; the final grade is converted to CR/NC.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"c9\" name=\"c9\"></a>Declaring a Major</h3>\n<div class=\"OutlineElement Ltr SCXW248578568 BCX4\">\n<p class=\"Paragraph SCXW248578568 BCX4\"><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW248578568 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW248578568\">The College of Liberal A</span></span><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW248578568 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW248578568\">rts and Sciences actively supports students in their search for a major that is both personally and professional rewarding.\u00a0</span></span><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW248578568 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW248578568\">Resources to help students facilitate their search are available\u00a0</span></span><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW248578568 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW248578568\">on the</span></span>\u00a0<a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW248578568 BCX4\" href=\"http://career.las.uic.edu/explore-my-major-pages/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW248578568 TextRun Underlined\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW248578568\">Explore LAS Majors</span></span></a><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW248578568 TextRun Underlined\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW248578568\">\u00a0web page</span></span><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW248578568 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW248578568\">.</span></span>\u00a0<span class=\"BCX4 SCXW248578568 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW248578568\">While a student may begin taking courses in\u00a0</span></span><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW248578568 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW248578568\">a\u00a0</span></span><span class=\"BCX4 SCXW248578568 TextRun\" data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"BCX4 NormalTextRun SCXW248578568\">major at any time, a student must declare a major no later than the completion of 45 semester hours.

The student must complete 30 semester hours of credit at UIC beyond the requirements for the first degree in courses not offered for the first degree. In addition, the student must complete all degree requirements of the college (foreign language, quantitative reasoning, and general education)\u00a0and the major department. For specific information on these requirements, consult the department listings in the catalog.</p>\n<p>A second bachelor\u2019s degree will not be approved if the first degree and the proposed second degree involve study of a similar area or substantial duplication of course work, see prohibited degree program list under double degree. Proposed second degrees involving the same area of study with a minor may not be approved. The student must apply via the office of admissions as a second degree seeking student. The college does not approve requests for more than two bachelor\u2019s degrees, nor for bachelor's degrees subsequent to a graduate degree. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences reserves the right to restrict enrollment of students into its academic programs based on space availability.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"c11\" name=\"c11\"></a>Rules Governing the Major</h3>\n<p>The major consists of discipline-specific courses, excluding required prerequisite and collateral courses outside of the major department. Specialized curricula include all courses required for the undergraduate degree. Degree program listings in the department sections address these differences.</p>\n<p>A liberal arts and sciences degree program may not include less than 27 or more than 40 semester hours of course work in the major field and 36 semester hours of prerequisites and collateral course work. For those departments and programs that require prerequisites and collateral courses, the total field of specialization may not exceed 72 semester hours. Writing-in-the-Discipline courses may be excluded from this limitation. The major, exclusive of collateral courses, must include 14 semester hours of upper-division (200-, 300-, or 400-level) courses. Specialized curricula must meet the minimum requirements for graduation in the college. The maximum number of hours allowed in a specialized curriculum will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<h4>Double Major</h4>\n<p>Cross-listed courses may count toward specific requirements in each major, <u>including the semester hours</u>. A student need not repeat course work, duplicate requirements, or make up semester hours to complete the second major. Students may not double major across colleges.\u00a0</p>\n<h3><a id=\"c12\" name=\"c12\"></a>Graduate-Level Courses for Undergraduate Credit</h3>\n<p>With department approval, an undergraduate student may enroll in a course in the Graduate College (500-level) for undergraduate elective credit. Prior to enrollment, students must obtain approval and must have met course prerequisites.</p>\n<p>Students should understand that graduate-level courses taken by an undergraduate student are generally not applicable toward a graduate degree, except in designated joint degree programs.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"c13\" name=\"c13\"></a>Cross-Listed Courses</h3>\n<p>Courses cross-listed in two or more departments have equivalent standing in each department and are treated as the same course regardless of the department under which the registration occurs.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"c14\" name=\"c14\"></a>Independent Study Course Options</h3>\n<p>A number of departments offer independent study course options (research, field experience, internship, and independent study) in which a student\u2019s special interests may be pursued under the direction of a faculty member. To enroll in such a course in any UIC college, the LAS student must have a minimum 2.50/4.00 grade point average in all course work taken at UIC and must obtain consent of the instructor and the department offering the course prior to registration. No student may enroll in an independent study course option after the tenth day of the term without approval of the department and the dean\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>A maximum of 8 semester hours in any of the independent study course options in a given department or program may count toward the degree. No more than 16 semester hours of independent study credit may apply toward the degree. Because many of these courses may not be repeated, students should consult the catalog for specific credit limitations. Please note fieldwork and internship courses that are specifically required in the major as stated in this catalog are excluded from this limitation.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"c15\" name=\"c15\"></a>Petition Procedure</h3>\n<p>Any rule, regulation, or action of the college may be appealed in writing. Continuing students must initiate the petitions procedure in consultation with their assigned academic advisor. Former students may submit petitions to the Office of the Dean, LAS Student Academic Affairs, third floor, University Hall. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to provide documentation in support of a petition. To be eligible for consideration a petition must address an academic term within the last two years.\u00a0<span>Submission of a petition does not imply approval. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><a id=\"c16\" name=\"c16\"></a>Proficiency Examinations</h3>\n<p>LAS departments may offer proficiency examinations, which are similar in content to regularly scheduled final course exams. To take such an exam, however, a student must meet the eligibility requirements of both the college and department. Consideration for such approval includes a careful review of the student\u2019s secondary and postsecondary records. If approval is granted, the minimum passing grade that a student must earn is a C, although a department may require a higher passing grade. When credit is awarded, a grade of P (Pass) is assigned. The Pass grade is not included in a student\u2019s grade point average, but the credit may apply toward the total hours required for graduation. Note that proficiency credit does not apply toward nor interrupt the 30-hour enrollment residence requirement for graduation.</p>\n<p>Although other limitations apply, proficiency exams may not be taken by a student who has credit for more than one course in the subject above the level of the course in which the exam is required. For more detailed information on eligibility criteria, consult Proficiency Examinations for Enrolled Students in the <em><a href=\"/ucat/degree-programs/academic-standing/\">Academic Standing</a></em> section.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"c17\" name=\"c17\"></a>Retroactive Credits in Foreign Language</h3>\n<p>A student who has placed into the 104 or higher level of a foreign language taught at UIC as the result of the UIC administered placement tests may receive academic proficiency credits for prerequisite courses.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Placement into the 104-level provides four hours of proficiency credit for the 103-level course if the student completes the 104-level course with a grade of B or higher.</li>\n\t<li>Placement into the final course in a heritage language sequence will provide four hours of credit for the prerequisite course, if the student completes the course with a B or higher.</li>\n\t<li>Placement at the 200-level, i.e., student has satisfied the college foreign language requirement through placement testing, provides four hours of proficiency credit for the 103-level course and four hours of proficiency credit for the 104-level course if the student completes the 200-level course with a grade of B or higher. The same provision applies to heritage language course placement except that proficiency credit is awarded for the two previous prerequisite heritage courses.</li>\n\t<li>These credits are awarded only for courses taught at UIC and only on the basis of new student placement test results for those with no prior college-level foreign language credits. Retroactive credit may be applied for a single student for more than one language sequence. \u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Proficiency credits appear as \u201cCR\u201d on the transcript and are not calculated into the grade point average. Proficiency credit does not apply to placements based on AP or IB scores for which credits are applied in a prescribed manner. CLEP credits are not accepted for foreign language courses.</li>\n\t<li>Proficiency credit is not awarded for a 104-level course if a student has transfer, AP, or IB credit for a 103-level course, and then places into and receives an A or B in a 200-level course at UIC.</li>\n\t<li>Students to whom this section applies must initiate the request for the credits with their assigned academic advisor in the LAS Academic Advising Center, third floor, University Hall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a id=\"c18\" name=\"c18\"></a>Registration Approval</h3>\n<p>All new first-year students are required to attend an orientation program prior to registration. Certain students, such as readmits, may be required to see their assigned \u00a0advisor prior to registration. First-year students are required to meet with a college academic advisor during their first two semesters in order to register for the following semester. The LAS Academic Advising Center is located on the third floor of University Hall.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"c19\" name=\"c19\"></a>Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses</h3>\n<p>Students may repeat a course to increase their knowledge of the subject matter. There are circumstances under which repeating a course is advisable and to a student\u2019s advantage. There are also circumstances in which repeating a course may disadvantage a student and narrow a student\u2019s options. Some colleges require students to discuss any plan to repeat a course with their academic advisor before they register to repeat the course.</p>\n<p>Courses in which a student earned a grade of A or B or C may not be repeated. Courses with D or F grades may be repeated once without written permission. In all cases, the original grade for the course and the grade for each repeat will appear on the transcript. The original grade and the grade for each repeat will be calculated into the grade point average. Only one registration for the course counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation. A student may not repeat a course after receiving credit in a course for which the repeat course is a prerequisite, administrative sanctions may apply.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To repeat a course more than once (third attempt) requires written permission from the student\u2019s college dean. Failure to obtain consent is subject to administrative registration revision. Students who have been dismissed may not appeal on the grounds of intention to repeat courses. Certain courses may not be repeated; students should consult their college before repeating a course.</p>\n<h4><strong><span class=\"diffadded\" id=\"htmldiff6\" title=\"Added

name=\"c20\"></a>Transferring</h3>\n<h4>Intercollege Transfer Students</h4>\n<p>Students currently enrolled at UIC who want to transfer into the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences should complete an <a href=\"https://www.las.uic.edu/intercollegetransfer\" target=\"_blank\">Intercollege Transfer Application</a>. Students are invited to discuss their academic interests with an LAS academic advisor during intercollege transfer information sessions, which are regularly scheduled throughout the fall and spring semesters. Applications must be submitted by the end of a given term. Admission to LAS is generally limited to those students in good academic standing who have a UIC grade point average of at least 2.00/4.00 and whose combined UIC and transfer grade point average is at least 2.00. Those students who are accepted into LAS are expected to enroll immediately in courses that fulfill LAS degree requirements.</p>\n<h4>Transfer Students from Other Colleges and Universities</h4>\n<p>Students applying to the college as transfers\u2014those who will have earned at least 36 semester hours or 54 quarter hours of credit by the time of enrollment\u2014must submit complete transcripts from all postsecondary institutions. Provided space is available, a minimum 2.50/4.00 grade point average is required for consideration. Transfer applicants with fewer hours are encouraged to apply if they have at least one graded term of college course work (high school transcripts and ACT/SAT scores will be required in this case). Please consult the <em><a href=\"/ucat/admissions-registration-finances/admissions/\">Admissions</a></em> section of the catalog for more information. See the Office of Admission <a href=\"https://admissions.uic.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-requirements-deadlines/transfer-requirements/transfer\" target=\"_blank\">Transfer Guide</a> for more information about transfer admission requirements.</p>\n<h4>Transferring out of the College</h4>\n<p>An LAS student who wants to transfer into another UIC college must follow the procedures of that college.

All LAS undergraduates are assigned an academic advisor. LAS operates under a two-tiered academic advising model. This means that students have at least two main advising contacts to guide them in navigating their undergraduate academic career, their assigned college advisor and departmental advisor. <a href=\"las.uic.edu/advising\" target=\"_blank\">LAS advisors</a> exist to advise students from orientation to graduation and will aid in students' overall academic development and completion of degree requirements. <a href=\"las.uic.edu/departmentaladvising\" target=\"_blank\">Departmental advisors</a> are available to assist students in navigating the requirements of their chosen, or potential, major or minor. In addition, LAS offers preprofessional advisors to facilitate students' completion of course requirements for <a href=\"http://prehealth.las.uic.edu/\">pre-health</a> and<a href=\"https://prelaw.las.uic.edu/\"> pre-law</a> educational goals. To schedule an appointment with an advisor(s), students should login to https://student.las.uic.edu.</p>\n<h3><strong>Academic Advising Mission Statement</strong></h3>\n<p>The Office of Student Academic Affairs of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences recognizes that undergraduate students expect to receive a quality education in a quality environment. It is the role of Student Academic Affairs to ensure that, in the continuum from admission through graduation, the student's individual educational needs are met while maintaining the academic standards established by the faculty of the college. As a primary source of college information, the staff of LAS Student Academic Affairs promotes and facilitates excellence through academic advising. The Office of LAS Student Academic Affairs believes that its services should assist in maximizing the academic experience and student achievement in the expectation that students will become lifelong learners and attain their career objectives. These services are provided with expertise, courtesy, and a positive attitude.</p>\n<h3><strong><a id=\"CohortAcademicAdvising\" name=\"CohortAcademicAdvising\"></a>Cohort Academic Advising</strong></h3>\n<p>All students are assigned an LAS academic advisor and exist as part of that advisor\u2019s student cohort for the duration of their academic career at UIC\u2014from orientation to graduation. Assigning students to a specific academic advisor at the very start of a student\u2019s academic career facilitates a connection between the student and advisor, resulting in a relationship that allows advisors to assist their students as they pursue their academic goals, while also addressing the students\u2019 emotional, cultural, personal, and developmental concerns and/or pursuits. Additionally, LAS academic advisors advocate for and assist their students with navigating campus and college policies and procedures. The creation of cohorts as early as orientation allows students to immediately make contact with other students and, therefore, initiates the peer relationships that are critical to helping students feel more connected and engaged with their UIC campus community. Students may identify and schedule an appointment with their assigned advisor by logging into https://student.las.uic.edu.</p>\n<h4><strong>Mandatory First-Year Advising (MFA)</strong></h4>\n<p>All first-year students must make an appointment with their assigned LAS academic advisor in both the fall and spring terms of their first year in order to be able to register for classes for the next term. First-year students will be contacted via their UIC email with additional information about this requirement; however, students should feel free to make an LAS advising appointment at any point during their first two terms at UIC. Although students are not required to see an advisor after their first year, LAS recommends that students see their LAS academic advisor at least once each term.</p>\n<h4><strong>Sophomore Success</strong></h4>\n<p>In order to help students connect with their academic departments, and/or to provide support if students are truly undecided, all sophomores must participate in Sophomore Success advising during the fall term of their second year in order to be able to register for the spring term. Options for completing Sophomore Success advising include: departmental group advising, major exploration workshop participation (i.e. Finding Your Fit in an LAS Major), departmental individual advising, or general individual advising (if pursuing a \u201cTeaching of\u201d degree or interested in an intercollege transfer out of LAS). Sophomore students are notified about this requirement during spring mandatory first-year advising appointment, and will also be contacted via their UIC email with additional information.</p>\n<h3><strong><a id=\"DepartmentalAcademicAdvising\" name=\"DepartmentalAcademicAdvising\"></a>Departmental Academic Advising </strong></h3>\n<p>Departmental advisors are experts in particular major and minor areas of study. They outline major and minor requirements for students, map out plans for the completion of these requirements, assist students with course sequencing for the major or minor, and provide general information about career options with the major or minor. Students should meet with their departmental advisor(s) at least once each term to confirm their progress in the major, and to ensure that they are taking advantage of all of the resources available to them. Because departmental advisors focus more specifically on major and minor requirements, it is still expected for students to make contact with an <a href=\"http://www.las.uic.edu/students/current-undergraduate/student-affairs/las-advising\" target=\"_blank\">LAS academic advisor</a> regarding their overall academic progress.\u00a0Students may schedule an appointment with their assigned advisor by logging into https://student.las.uic.edu. Additionally, departmental advisor contact information is listed under the major requirements of each degree audit report.</p>\n<h3><strong><a id=\"DegreeAuditReporting(DARS)\" name=\"DegreeAuditReporting(DARS)\"></a>UAchieve Degree Audit</strong></h3>\n<p>The uAchieve Degree Audit is an individualized report that displays all courses a student has completed and demonstrates their progress towards meeting their degree requirements. A student\u2019s degree audit is available to them at any time via uAchieve Degree Audit in the student portal: <a href=\"http://my.UIC.edu\" target=\"_blank\">my.UIC</a>. Students should review their degree audit regularly and always consult with their LAS academic advisor(s) if they have questions. uAchieve also features the ability to view a hypothetical degree audit, which allows a student to see how their completed and in-progress courses would be applied to a major that is different than their current one.</p>\n<p>The responsibility for selecting courses and meeting graduation requirements rests with the students, who must plan intelligently to make their programs consistent with their goals and with college requirements. All LAS students should obtain a uAchieve Degree Audit analysis from an academic advisor in the college at least annually.</p>\n<p>This analysis of earned credits can assist students in planning their program of study. Degree audit reports obtained online should be confirmed by a college advisor. Four-year plans of study are available for each academic program and serve as a guide for degree planning. See specific departments for more details.\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong><a id=\"MajorExplorationandCareerDevelopment\" name=\"MajorExplorationandCareerDevelopment\"></a>Major Exploration and Career Development</strong></h3>\n<p>The LAS Office of Career Development offers an array of programming including Finding Your Fit Workshops, Career Interest Mashup Labs, Pre-Professional Off-Site Tour Workshops, and events such as Minute Majors and Health Professions Forum to help students explore interests among major choices and various career paths.\u00a0 Learning tools, assessments, and exploratory website guides are also available online to support LAS students with their self-guided research and development of their professional identity. For more information regarding choosing a major and career exploration, students can visit the <a href=\"http://career.las.uic.edu\" target=\"_blank\">LAS Office of Career Development website</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Once a student has decided on a major, it is recommended that they <a href=\"http://www.las.uic.edu/students/current-undergraduate/student-affairs/ departmental-advising\" target=\"_blank\">make an appointment with their departmental advisor</a>\u00a0</span><span>every semester. Topics in these appointments might include: course selection and progress in major courses, long-term planning, and enrichment opportunities such as research, internships, independent study, or study abroad. In addition to opportunities available through their academic departments, all students are encouraged to participate in complementary career development activities, such as: work experience, campus involvement, volunteering, community service, and networking through job shadowing and informational interviews with a variety of professionals. LAS students are also encouraged to visit the internship advising staff to learn about the LAS Internship Program, internship exploration process,\u00a0experiential learning opportunities, options for course credit, and ways to strengthen marketability through various internship prep workshops.</span></p>\n<p>Additionally, for a full range of career planning resources, career advising services, job fair/networking events, and employment outreach, students should visit the Office of Career Services located in the Student Services Building to see one of the specialized counselors who can provide such guidance. \u00a0Students can access services and resources offered through this office at the <a href=\"http://careerservices.uic.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Office of Career Services website</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong><a id=\"PreprofessionalAdvising\" name=\"PreprofessionalAdvising\"></a>Preprofessional Advising</strong></h3>\n<p>Preprofessional advisors are available to assist students who have a declared\u00a0<a href=\"http://prehealth.las.uic.edu/ and https://prelaw.las.uic.edu/)\">educational goal</a>\u00a0in a preprofessional field such as pre-medicine, pre-law, and pre-pharmacy, to name a few. Preprofessional educational goals are\u00a0<strong>not\u00a0</strong>majors in LAS. Students who have an educational goal must also have a declared major to be eligible to graduate from LAS. Prior to applying for admission to a professional program, many programs require the completion of specific course work. Preprofessional advisors are available to assist students in carefully selecting course work to fulfill educational goal requirements. They also provide guidance to students through webinars, appointments, and workshops\u00a0that help students brainstorm how their current and future experiences can help them achieve their goals, prepare for the application process, craft a personal statement, and navigate the letter of recommendation process. Students with educational goals should continue to work with LAS cohort and departmental advisors as they progress through their requirements toward graduation.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"d\" name=\"d\"></a>Preprofessional Studies</h2>\n<p>Preprofessional studies are designed for students who intend to pursue their undergraduate or graduate education in professional schools of the University of Illinois. Preprofessional areas are\u00a0<u>not major areas of study</u>\u00a0for the proposed degrees and are designated as educational goals in student records. Preprofessional study is offered in the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Pre-Dentistry</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Health Information Management</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Law</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Medicine</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Nursing</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Nutrition</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Occupational Therapy</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Pharmacy</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Physical Therapy</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Public Health</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Veterinary Medicine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Advisors for students in these areas are available in the LAS Academic Advising Center to answer students\u2019 questions about admissions requirements and procedures and to assist students in planning their programs of study. Many of the professional schools encourage prospective students to visit their college offices in order to obtain more detailed information on the programs. Pre-health or pre-law students should consult an LAS advisor regarding any changes in professional school admissions requirements.</p>\n<p>Designation of a preprofessional area does not guarantee admission to a professional school, nor does completion of the required course work or attainment of the minimum grade point average. Preprofessional students should follow an LAS degree program whether or not a bachelor\u2019s degree is required for admission to the professional program. Once 60 semester hours are earned, an LAS major must be declared.</p>\n<p>Because application procedures as well as deadlines vary among the professional schools of the University of Illinois, students are encouraged to consult both an LAS preprofessional advisor and the individual program to which application is planned.\u00a0</p>\n<h3><a id=\"d1\" name=\"d1\"></a>Studies in the Health Sciences</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Pre-Dentistry</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Medicine</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Occupational Therapy</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Physical Therapy</li>\n\t<li>Pre-Veterinary Medicine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LAS students in these areas of the health sciences complete all requirements for the bachelor\u2019s degree, including a major, in addition to their preprofessional studies at UIC.
